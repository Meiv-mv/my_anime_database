# my_anime_database
A site that you can use to list films, tv series, anime, manga and books that you love!<br>
**Link:** https://meiv-mv.github.io/the-nerd-database/

**Description:**<br>
This is site is a project I made to practice OOP for frontend developing, so it will not have a storage, but I'll eventually work to make use local storage.<br>
The goal of this project is to effectively use OOP in order to render a list of every item(films, tv series, anime, manga, books) the user want to store.

**Future Update:**
  - Local Storage
  - Dark Theme
  - Server Side
  - Update Minor Feature
